# Processes of Operating systems
## What is a Process?
```A process is a program in execution.```
It is more than just the program code (called the text section); it includes:

1. Program code (what to execute)
2. Program counter (current instruction being executed)
3. Registers
4. Stack (function calls, parameters)
5. Heap (dynamically allocated memory)
6. Data section (global/static variables)

A process is like a container that holds everything needed to run a program.

```
ðŸ“Œ Example:
If you open a browser and open two tabs with two different websites:

The browser program is the same.
But the OS runs two different processes (each with its own memory and state).
```
**A program can have multiple processes**
